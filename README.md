# Disaster Response Pipeline
Analyze disaster data via building ETL and ML pipelines using data engineering skills

# Installation:
This project uses Python3 and HTML.  It uses the following packages: pandas, nltk, sklearn, numpy, flask, json, plotly, re,   pickle, and sqlalchemy.
  
# Overview:
This project builds a model to classify responses submitted after natural disasters.  The goal of the model is to correctly predict the type of message using only text.  Correct classification allows responders to prioritize responses and correctly and efficiently allocate resources at times when they are needed most.

The project has three main parts:
1.  An ETL pipeline to process data
2.  A machine learning pipeline to build the model and classify messages
3.  A web app to easily visualize and gain insights regarding messages received
